We are students, faculty and friends of the [Schulich School of Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/) at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/).

Blog posts by Digital Engineering Fellows created during the Spring 2022 term were supported by a **Schulich School of Engineering - Engineering Education Innovation Award**.

If you have questions or suggestions for improvements, please contact the author of the blog post directly, open an issue (or pull request) in the [github repository](https://github.com/de-fellows/RexCoding).
