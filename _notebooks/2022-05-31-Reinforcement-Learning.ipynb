    "## What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the context of Machine Learning (ML) is one of the three fundamental ML paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs_for_RL/venn.png\" alt=\"ML Intersection\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To properly answer this question, we first need to dive into the different aspects of RL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, we will use certain terminology to discuss the nature of RL. It is crucial to understand their meanings and how they distinguish RL from the other branches of ML. To get things started, we will present the notion of an **agent** existing in an **environment.** \n",
    "\n",
    "An **environment** in the relevant context refers to a space - not necessarily a physical one - that exists and can be interacted with. Interactions with such an environment are called **actions** and should produce some sort of response that can be percieved by anything existing in that environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **agent** exists in an environment and is able to percieve it, meaning that any response that the environment produces can be experienced by the agent. More specifically, an **intelligent agent** (IA) is one who takes non-random actions based on feedback from an environment. This feedback comes in the form of two notions, **state** and **reward**, which we will discuss more later. An IA takes said actions in order to reach some desirable end result. They may exhibit learning by adjusting their actions over time, or memory by using past experiences in an environment to adjust their current actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these concepts together, RL involves an agent learning to take actions in an environment to reach some goal."

   "source": [
    "## Making a Move\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of RL, it is necessary to have actions performed in a controlled and measurable manner so that we may use information produced by the environment for the benefit of learning. This is where our **step function** comes into play. A step function can be thought of as the process of taking an action, and recieving a response. It is best summarized in a diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs_for_RL/RLflow.jpg\" alt=\"RL flowchart\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see the aforementioned terms **state** and **reward** appearing in this flowchart. The state of the environment embodies some variable that describes the environment and changes over time. For example, humidity may be a state variable of the atmosphere. The reward is some feedback from the environment that characterizes the action taken by the agent. A desirable action outcome recieves a positive reward, while an undesireable outcome recieves a negative reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent chooses to take an action A on the environment at time t based on the current state S at that same time t. The current action A applied on the environment results in a new state produced at time t+1. As we 'take a step,' The new state becomes the current, producing a certain action. The cycle repeats, each being called a **step**. This results in a continuous feedback loop that allows the agent to exist meaningfully."

    "## Decisions, Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "The pertinent question still remains, how *does* an IA make decisions, or learn to do so? Noteably in the previous section, we had little to say about the reward aspect of the flowchart. This reward is what teaches our IA to make certain decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'brain' of the IA is the **policy network**. In essence, this is a mathematical function that takes a set of inputs and maps them to an output space. This function has parameters that can be changed to produce different outputs for a given input set. We can exploit this relationship if we are able to determine how to tune these parameters such that the mapping function always leads our IA to the best output based on its inputs. This is the concept of **learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, in RL an IA learns to tune these parameters so that it always makes the best choice for a given environment state. The notion of 'best' is where our reward comes in. If an IA recieves a positive reward for an action performed due to an input state, we tune the policy network's parameters such that the IA is a bit more likely to produce the same action the next time that state comes around. If an IA recieves a negative reward (penalty), we do the opposite and tune so that it is less likely to repeat this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'tuning' process is a vastly complex topic that need not be explained here to grasp the idea of RL. It suffices to know why this tuning happens and how it affects the IA's behaviour."

It is a field with diverse reach that finds a place for itself in a modern world concerned with automation. Simple environments like the one presented here can serve as an analogue to more real-world problems. Having given this introduction, I implore the reader to further their knowledge into Reinforcement Learning.\n",

A great stepping stone would be to look into the [OpenAI Gym Documentation ](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/) and explore the environemnets available its users, which range from Atari game recreations to simple 3D locomotion simulations. Try your hand at creating an agent to traverse these environments and along the way explore the various tweaks that can be applied during training to maximize your score!"
