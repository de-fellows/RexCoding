    "## Introduction\n",
    "Streamlit is an open-source Python framework used for building interactive web applications. It simplifies the process of creating and deploying data science and machine learning models by providing a user-friendly interface. With Streamlit, Python scripts can be converted into web applications without the need for extensive web development knowledge. It allows a coder to create interactive and responsive UI components, such as sliders, buttons, dropdown menus, and data visualizations, with just a few lines of code. Coding with Streamlit is similar to coding with Graphic User Interface modules like tkinter, where the coder can add widgets and interactive functions to the application. This creates a “junior version” of a project where the coder does not have to worry about Webserver developing with POST and GET methods, but focus more on front-end developing like sorting through data with Pandas module, and back-end GUI development. Hence, this tackles the **Play the whole game** principle of Perkins’ [Making Learning Whole](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators) paradigm."

This shows lines of markdown text that can be modified. As an example, the color of the title will be changed to the Warriors yellow using hex-code color through markdown format. In addition, it is important to use the argument `unsafe_allow_html=True` as it allows color markdown format to show in the web application. Please refer to [Streamlit API Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) for more details regarding different types of Streamlit widgets."

    "### Bar Chart Plotting for Field Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting, it is necessary to take into account what will happen when the user does not input any seasonal year. An if-else statement is used for said situation, where the else statement contains `st.error`, which shows an error asking the user to input at least one seasonal year if there are none inputted. Within the if statement, the Field goal data is sorted using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#api) slicing for the user-inputted seasonal years. Then the success rate is calculated using the Field Goals Made and Field Goals Attempted data. It is important to note that the Python method `sorted` is used to sort the user-inputted seasonal years. This means that no matter the order that the user selected the years, the seasonal years displayed on the bar chart is always from the earliest to the latest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot the bar chart, the Python charting library `plotly` is used through `st.plotly_chart`, specifically `plotly.graph_objects` is imported to access the bar chart drawing functions. `matplotlib.pyplot` may also be used through `st.pyplot`. However, `plotly` is integrated better with Streamlit. Please refer to the `Chart elements` section of the [API Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/charts) for more details about the available Streamlit plotting widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the code section below, an instance `go.Figure` is created where the argument contains the method `go.Bar` to plot the bar graphs of the Field Goals Made (FGM) and Field Goals Attempted (FGA) of the user-inputted seasonal years. Within it, the `hovertext` argument in `plotly` allows the user to hover over the bar chart to see the percentage success, calculated using the FGM and FGA. Finally, the graph title and axis labels are edited using `update_layout` method. Then, the Figure instance is inputted to `st.plotly_chart` to display the graph on the web appplication."

    "\n",
    "Through Streamlit, one can easily create a web application displaying data visualization. Using the Field Goals Made and Field Goals Attempted data of Steph Curry, an example of the web application was shown. It is encouraged to go through the [API Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) and expand on this example through `Supplementary exercise 1`, or create a new web application through `Supplementary exercise 2`. I hope you are able to gain a new understanding about Streamlit."
