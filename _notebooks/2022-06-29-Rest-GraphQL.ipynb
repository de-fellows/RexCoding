    "In the scope of this project, we are going to focus on the fourth principle **Playing out of town** from *Making Learning Whole:* [Education at Bat: Seven Principles for Educators](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators). David Perkins focuses on the learner's ability to take their skills to the next level. He encourages learners to develop transferrable knowledge that can be used flexibly in other fields. For instance, \n",
    "1. Students already know how to use Flask to develop a web server. \n",

    "Students are encouraged to discover how to use their previece knowledge and skills to achieve a similar output with a different approach. By the end of this article, students will have:\n",

    "## Brief introduction\n",
    "API stands for *Application Programming Interface*, A set of definitions and protocols for integrating web applications. In other words, it is a setup that allows two pieces of software to connect and communicate with each other. We know that every software differs from one another. When the two pieces of software communicate, one software will deal with whatever in the backend which is the main server. The other software will make requests to the server to retrieve data in the frontend. Rest API stands for *Representational State Transfer*. As the name implies, this type of API helps transfer data over the internet. This allows users to only view specific things from the backend. It is time that we introduce GraphQL. GraphQL is a query programming language for APIs and a server-side runtime. It simply gives the client the privelage of to ask for exactly what they need and only what the need, This makes it easier when dealing with more complex databases that contain huge amounts of data. GraphQL is used to query data from any number of sources. Thankfully, both Rest APIs and graphQL pair with python nicely. In this project, we will try to build an application to store information about music genres using Rest API and then we will try to implement it with graphQL. This example is inspired from Caleb Curry where you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbLc5a9jdXo&list=LL&index=3). \n",

Flask runs on localhost:5000. However, any other framework will do the job. We are going to install the dependencies that we need to be able to work with the framework in our preferred environment.

    "##  Introduction to GraphQL\n",
    "We introduced the query language GraphQL, but the question is, what makes GraphQL more unique, and how does it differ from a REST API? REST APIs are modelled as resources. We provide various endpoints to access particular data and define which HTTP methods are used at each endpoint. On the other hand, GraphQL models the API as a graph. It generates only one endpoint across all objects. The GraphQL special _Schema Definition Language_ (SDL) allows for defining the types and fields of each type of data. The types defined in a GraphQL schema are treated as nodes. The client can then make queries at a specific endpoint to access data at that particular node of interest to get the specific data it wants. For more information, look at the official [GraphQL documentaion](https://graphql.org/learn/). The main advantages of querying data with GraphQL are:\n",
    "- Reduces web-app development efforts.\n",
    "- Reduces bandwidth: querying only what we need and only what we need\n",
    "- Reduces the number of requests \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Requirements**\n",
    "As mentioned previously, flask is just a framework that makes it easier to build and configure web applications, and Flask_SQLAlchemy is an extension used for flask that allows us to interact with our SQL database using SQLAlchemy. Introducing `Graphene`, it is a library that helps us implement and integrate GraphQL APIs in python. Several other libraries can be used to integrate GraphQL APIs (for example, Ariadne). However, for this project, we will work with Graphene.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between Ariadne and Graphene?  \n",
    "The main difference between the two is that Ariadne uses a `schema-first` approach while Graphene uses a `code-first` approach. What does this mean? A schema-first approach is about writing the schema first and then implementing the code to satisfy the definitions of the schema. In a code_first approach, we start by coding the resolvers which are finctions connecting the schema types to the backend. As a result, the schema is generated based on our code. According to Prisma's Nikolas Burk, we chose Graphene because there are no features supported by a schema-first approach that is not supported by a code-first approach. \n",

    "### Developing our GraphQL Alternative \n",
    "To avoid confusion, we will use the same exapmle from `RestApp.py` in a different module which we will call `graphQL_App.py`. We will start adding to the code and integrate the graphQL method step by step in that new module. First of all, we need to install the library Graphene. Graphene comes with a built in support for SQLAlchemy. We will also need the GraphQL extension for flask to be able to view the schema theough HTTP.

Thus, we will go ahead and write the following commands in the terminal to install the remaining dependencies:"

    "Now we can make queries our database through this GraphiQL tool. A `Query` is the equivielant to a `GET` request when working with REST APIs. We can request data in a Query and receive data in a Response containing only the requested data. Looking at the example below, the response on the right has the same shape as the query itself. This is to make it easier to identify the fields that are returned taking into consideration that no other fields other than the ones specified in the query will be fetched."

    "GraphQL Queries can be implemented to cause modifications to the data in the server. By convention, any peration that causes a data write in GraphQL is called a mutation. `Mutations` are the equivalent of the `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods. In the context of this example, the mutation class will refer to another class `CreateMusic`. Refer to the code under _A mutation class_. Lets test our mutation class by creating a new entry."
